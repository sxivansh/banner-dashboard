# banner-dashboard
 This project is a dynamic one-page website using React and Node.js with Express. It features a banner with a countdown timer, managed via an internal dashboard. The dashboard allows toggling the banner, updating its content, setting a timer, and adding a link. All data is stored in a MySQL database for persistent settings across sessions.
